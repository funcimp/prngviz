# prngviz
random experiments with prng and visualizations using svelte and d3. I am terrible with both so this is your warning. 

the goal, currently is to create a prng generated visualization that is reproducable, but meets the criteria of randomness while being able to proceedurally generate from a seed  
 TODO: move to plain JS
